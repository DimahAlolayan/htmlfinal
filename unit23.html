    <h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed –
        in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.
    </h3> <br>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Visual studio code and trello board were used for this project.
        Those tools were very helpful for many reasons.
        Visual studio code has so many features such as shortcuts to save time and effort,
        it combines the css and html files together and it is very easy, and it is one of the best coding environments
        that I've used.
        trello was a very useful tool, it is super effective for managing tasks to develop the webpage and write the web
        content.
    </p><br>

    <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3><br>
    <p class="paragraph">
        The IT tools that were used for this project were suitable for the project’s needs.
        Visual studio code was helpful for combining the project files under one package, and it has the shortcut
        feature which helped me alot with saving time, it’s also a very good and powerful coding environment to work
        with.
        Trello allowed to breakup all the tasks into smaller ones to know exactly what is needed each day.

    </p><br>

    <h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website?
        Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
    </h3><br>

    <p class="paragraph">
        One of The main strengths points is the site’s plan and content was obvious.
        The weakness point is that this is my first time coding a web page so i couldn’t add all the features.
        Yes i’m very happy with the final result since I didn’t have enough time to improve it more.
        However, if I had the time I would probably add so many more features such as a photo gallery,
        my travel journal and I would improve the overall style and design specially the navigation bar.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>
        2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project
    </h3><br>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Many improvements can be added to the project such as making the site mobile friendly and more flexible on
        different devices, we also can add a complaints and suggestions section to have more improvement ideas from the
        user and we can add a page of articles and writings and let the users get the opportunity to write and publish
        their own work.
        Improving the branding and the design will be very beneficial for the website to attract more users.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3><br>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Preparing appropriate content for my site by researching and collecting the right information, Organising and
        combining information needed for web pages including different platforms, Selecting and using appropriate
        editing and formatting techniques for clarity and good navigation to make the user have the best experience,
        making the website error free by testing the code and running the files every time we add any of the features.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <div class="unitAndOutcome">
        <h1><b>Unit One</b></h1><br>
        <h2><b>Outcome Three</b> </h2><br><span class="border"></span>
    </div>
    <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency –
        could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3><br>

    <p class="paragraph">
        I didn't find any difficulties working alone the only problem i faced was the time.
        However, If I had a chance to do it again I would probably choose working with a team, but I'll choose the
        team
        can serve the best for the website’s needs.
        I’ll have a powerful developer to work with and a professional CSS designer.
    </p><br>

    <h3> 3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3><br>
    <p class="paragraph">
        As a software developer I always need a break after spending more than 2 hours in front of a screen,
        so there are many ways to increase my output and to be more productive.
        Taking breaks for 10 minutes is always a good idea, or an exercise break such as yoga break to clear your mind
        and boost your energy.
        Regular breaks always help you to get more energy .
    </p><br>

    <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects –
        what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h3><br>
    <p class="paragraph">
        I would be more aware of the designing techniques, and i will also use more useful coding shortcuts and I will
        plan better since i have learned the website planning technique, for slack i would use it more to share the
        images that I want to implement in the website and I'll also use it to share all the information and ideas with
        the team, and we can use archived projects channels to get inspired by more ideas.
    </p> <br>

    <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solution </h3><br>
    <p class="paragraph">
        I found that testing was the most efficient way to clear your code from massive errors and to avoid
        complicated
        errors. Also, it was very helpful with the designing part to make sure that everything is in the right place
        and
        the navigation is smooth so the user could have a pretty good experience.
