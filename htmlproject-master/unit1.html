    <h3> 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3><br>

    <p class="paragraph">Information technology (IT) has become a vital and integral part of every business plan.
        multinational corporations who maintain mainframe systems and databases to small businesses that own a single
        computer, IT plays a role.
        The reasons for the omnipresent use of computer technology in business can best be determined by looking at how
        it is being used across the business world.

            The content will you be displaying on your website, Content is basically anything that
            gives your visitors
            information.
            It can include, Blog posts, Documents, Video, Pictures (such as in a gallery), Slideshows and Embedded

            <li>Structure your website.</li>
            Decide what pages you’ll be using and what features will be on each one.
            Most websites have an About and Contact page, but the pages you use should meet your business’ needs.
        </ul>

        <ul class="paragraph">
            <li>Create a mock-up.</li>
            A page mock-up, also know as a wireframe, is essentially the outline of your website (with
            the initial design
            being the first draft).
            Usually created in Photoshop or Fireworks, you don’t have to put too much detail into your mock-up. Use
            placeholder text to fill pages, and don’t worry about details.
            This is just to give everyone an idea of what the website will look like.
        </ul>

        <ul class="paragraph">
            <li>Start designing.</li>

            Make your navigation easy to understand and easy to find, Use an easy-to-read font for
            blocks of text.
            Choose a background color and text color that contrast well, Make sure your site fits the screen.
            Keep your website light so that it loads quickly, Make the company logo and tag line prominent on the
            page,

            Keep styles and colors consistent across the website, Make copy clear and concise, Make notes about what
            to
            include in the style sheet as you design, as you want to keep style and function separate and lastly
            You
            should also design with the future in mind.
        </ul>

        <ul class="paragraph">

        </ul>

        <ul class="paragraph">
            <li>Maintain your site.</li>
            Once your site is launched, the work isn’t over. A website is an ongoing entity that
            continuously represents
            your company,
            so maintenance is very important. <br><br> <a

    <h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </h3>
    <br>
    <p class="paragraph">
        <ol>
            <li class="paragraph">
                Misalignment with business processes:<br>
                Marketing may build a beautiful new website with a great user experience,
                but if they overlook the resulting impacts on the company’s business processes, the initiative is
                very
                likely to fail.<br><br>
            </li>

            <li class="paragraph">
                Lack of cross-functional expertise: <br>
                Similar to number 1, there’s a common misconception that digital projects only need “digital
                people.”
                But every digital project should have someone with business process management skills to help scope
                and
                plan the alignment between the customer journey and back-end operational processes.<br><br>
            </li>

            <li class="paragraph">
                Limited digital strategy:<br>
                Many digital projects are focused solely on the objective of one department or initiative, rather
                than
                contributing to the overall company’s digital strategy and business goals.
                Define specifically what success looks like for the project and how it contributes to the company’s
                business strategy before moving forward.<br><br>
            </li>

            <li class="paragraph">
                Fixed plans that don’t account for change:<br>
                The notion of a “5-year-plan” is dead. Using Agile, iterative processes that allow for frequent tweaks
                and improvement is the only way to ensure that success is lasting.
                Your digital project plans should be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and
                the market at any given moment.<br><br>
            </li>

            <li class="paragraph">
                Overambition: <br>
                Expecting perfection instead of embracing the “done is better than perfect” mantra tends to result in
                projects that drag on way past their scope.
                Explore the idea of releasing “Minimum Viable Products,” or early versions of software that gauge how
                the market will respond and determine if the concept is worth pursuing.<br><br> <a
                    href="https://www.celerity.com/5-reasons-digital-projects-fail-the-forgotten-role-of-business-process/#targetText=Most%20of%20these%20factors%20share,adoption%20of%20new%20digital%20products.">[online]</a>

    <h3> 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the
        right
        kind of technology for the job? </h3><br>
    <p class="paragraph">

        Researching and looking for the right technology that is suitable for the project’s needs and features,
        considering the project’s budget.
        However, in this project we chose visual studio code to build the website. The reason we chose this platform is
        because it supports hundreds of languages,
        also includes great tooling for web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript..
        We also chose trello to manage and organise all tasks and to have an obvious tasks per day which helps alot with
        time management.
        and we have chosen slack to share information and all images for the web page.

    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>
        1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. –
        How
        has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control
    </h3>
    <br>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Trello helped in many ways including organizing ideas and time management it was one of the important things to
        finish building the web page, it's a very useful planning board. But the most helpful feature was archiving the
        trello board which enables using it on different projects.
        Git and GitHub are very useful tools for saving the work and to look for more different codes.
        It helped mainly in editing or trying something new because it does not lose the original work
        and it is also helpful when working as a group to share the code and more.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects
        – How does GDPR impact digital projects?
    </h3><br>

    <p class="paragraph">There are significant legal constraints on the uploading and downloading of software and other
        digital
        content,
        including music and videos.
        Many items are copyright and can incorporate digital rights management, such as restricting the number of times
        a media file can be copied or converted to another format.
        When you buy software, you will normally receive a licence to use it. You do not own the software itself, nor
        do
        you have the right to copy it.
        Some types of licence, including freeware and shareware impose fewer restrictions.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        You should ensure that you are familiar with the rules of “netiquette” which describes the recommended
        conduct
        of users in various online environments.
        Remember that libellous behaviour is subject to the same restrictions (and penalties) whether it is online or
        offline. <br>
