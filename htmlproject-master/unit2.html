    <h3> 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3><br>
    <p class="paragraph">

        Copyright and other intellectual property laws affect websites because it may restrict
        what you are able to publish. The best way to get around this is first, get permission from the original
        author,
        second, if you want to publish information on your site from another site, link to it and perhaps get permission
        
        to publish an excerpt from the original site.<br>

        1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - 
        describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them

    </h3>
    <br>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Blindness:<br>
        images that do not have alt text
        complex images (e.g., graphs or charts) that are not adequately described
        video that is not described in text or audio<br><br>

        To access the Web, most individuals who are blind rely on screen readers (software that reads text on the
        screen
        with a synthetic voice) and / or refreshable braille displays (a device that dynamically displays lines of text
        on
        the screen in braille). Some people who are blind prefer text-based browsers to graphical browsers.<br><br>

        Color Blindness:<br>
        color that is used as a unique marker to emphasize text on a Web site
        text that inadequately contrasts with background color or patterns
        browsers that do not support user override of authors' style sheets<br><br>

        To use the Web, people with color blindness may use their own style sheets to override the font and
        background
        color choices of the author.
